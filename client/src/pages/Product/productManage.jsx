            <p style={{paddingTop: '20px', color: 'rgb(149, 149, 149)'}}>This complex, yet playful exploration of light and dark textures brings a modern twist to classic perfumery notes. A rich base of sumptuous dark leather is punctuated by the elegance of night blooming jasmine. Nostalgic notes of sweet cotton candy and herbal mate add a contemporary lightness to the perfume. Hidden notes that emerge as the fragrance dries down surprise you when you think you really know it.</p>
